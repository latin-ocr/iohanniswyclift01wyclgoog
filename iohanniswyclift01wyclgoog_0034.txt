XXIV INTRODUCTIOX.

aman isa castaway, it is lawful to communicate even with the
worst of men for theIr good. At present the greatest abuses prevail:
all excommunications may be raised or absolutioris obtained for
money: the latter are given to robbers through fear. lt is a proof
that neither is worth anything. Excommunicati0n ought, (1⁵¹) always
to arise from a feeling of charity toward the person excommunicated,
(2¹¹⁶) never to be prouounced chiefly on account of a temporal
motIve3 (Ψ) God's law should never be forsalren because of human
excommunications: they are then harmless thunderbolts. The duty of
the faithful isto remain steadfast, notwithstanding the intimidation
practised on both clergy and laity. If our persecutors say that obedience
is due to thern, we affirm that it is due to Christ alone, and to such as
follow Christ. We resist their excommunications, in spite of the unjust
Iaws that favour them; and we shall appeal to the king, as we have
the right to do. This right they themselves implicitly acknowledge
by calling for the aid of the secular arm.

Ch. Vlll nominally deals with the ‘fifth tormentor’, the official
whose business it was to obtain money by means of penance3 but
in reality it says nothing about him, and is completely filled up with
Wyclif’s opinions on the sacrament of Penance. In order to under-
stand fully in how far he agrees and iu how far he is in contradiction
with the Church of Rome, l must premise a few statements on the
Roman Catholic doctrine concernIng this subject.

The sacrament of Penance is necessary ιο salvation, but
not absolutely, only hypothetically (S. Th. 3³, qu. LXXXIV, art. 5).
No mortal sin can be remitted without, and all are forgiven with
Penance (qu. LXXXVI. art. r, 2). Penance removes the eternal‚ but
not necessarily the temporal punishment of sin (art. 4, 5). Sins once
forg'iven do not return, if the sinner falls again (qu. LXXXVIII,
art. ι). Penance consists of contrition, confession, and satisfaction
(qu. XC, arta). Contrition must extend ro all sins (suppl. 3²¹⁰ Partis,
qu. ll, art. 3), is the greatest of all sorrows, and cannot be excessive
in itself, only in its effects (qu. III, art. r, 2); it may, if sufficiently
intense, remove even all the temporal punishment due to sin (qu. V.art. 2).
Confession is necessary to salvation ‘vel actu . . . vel saltem votO,
quando articulus necessitatis, non contemptus, sacramentum excludit’.
- Thus, when it is possible to confess, confession must be made.
