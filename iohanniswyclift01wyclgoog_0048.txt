XXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

ssut as ‘soreknown' priests have not that power, we must suspect
that the water is not holy, il they do not follow Christ's law. A

priest who sometimes does wrong abuses his power; if he contiuually
does wrong, he cannot abuse it, for he has none. We should treat
Iroly water with all due reverence (p. 259) yet without excess, avoiding
exaggeration on both sides. As Ior consecrated oil, its adulterationis
a very serious matter, sInce the oil is consecrated by the Bishop‚ made
of costly ingredients, and used in Confirmation and Baptism: its
impurity would interfere with the integrity oI those sacraments.
Wyclil proceeds to point out the abuses concernIng clerlrs
(p. 261-272). Some ol them do not really, but only nomiually,
belong to the clergy. But lor such as d0, the practice of employing
them in secular charges, is without excuse, condemned by Canon
law, and adishonour to the Church. It is said to favour the pro-
sperity of the realm; but it is contrary to Christ's law, and ir the
Canons forbidding it have fallen into disuse, that cannot be said of
the law ol Christ. Anda man willing to be a traitor to God, the
King ol kings, may as well be a traitor to man als0. It is impossible
to serve both Christ and the king properly. Christ’s service has to
be abandoned. At least let them give up their benefices. This is
argued to be Impossible, lor the KIng can only afford to pay them
by means of those benefices. Here again is an argument against the
temporal possessions ol the clergy, an argument which the present
wretched condition of the poor tends to strengtlren. It is incompre-
hensible how secular Iords can rob the poor as they do, seeing that
the lands of the clergy belong to them by right, and would yield ,
ever so much more than what the poor can give, and they would
thus regenerare the clergy, now so corrupt, so neglectlul of the
people, so hated, and so unable to resist. Parliarnent should pass a
bill to that effect3 tallages should also be abolished, and the poor no
longer robbed. As matters stand, secular Iords are Iorced by circum·
stances to plunder their tenants, and thus indirectly to ruin themselves;
and their own enemics move them to persecute the Iaitlrful as lreretics.
The chapter closes with a petition in seven points to the King and
Parliament, summing up pretty nearly the whole ol Wyclil’s doctrine.
