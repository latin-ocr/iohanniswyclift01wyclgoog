exactly the point of view of those who call the excesses of the French
Revolution ‘a sort ol wild justice.’ l·le points out the lact that the
clergy possessed superfluous riches; buthe does not admit that they
ought to have been putto death on that account. Rather let them
live, but be deprived ol their temporalties. The clergy, who had
prompted the late war, were responsible for the great numbers of
soldiery in the country, whom they irritated rather than appeased
(pp. 191, 192). What had the Archbishop to do with the Chancellor·
ship, that most secular function ol all? He was evidently a traitor¹
(p. 194). lf the clergy does not reform, we shall yet see worse
disasters (p. 195). lt must, however, be admitted that the punishment
inflicted was excessive: ,se ln degree, the peuple having no right
to take away lile. 2¹¹⁶. ln quality. There was no form of justice,
onlya mere outburst of popular indignation. gra· ln manner3 for they
did not punish according to the fault, they rebelled against the
secular powers and they did not vvait to take the advice of the
whole kingdom (pp. 196, 197). On the other hand, we must not
forget their grievances. Let neither the secular powers, nor Rome,
nor the clergy, any longer rob the people.

Wyclif has not yet hinted at pardoning the rebels, but in the
answers to the objections that follow (p. 198-203) he shows his
purpose clearly. 1⁸1. What Wyclif proposes would diminish the
royal prerogative. - N0, soron the contrary the patience of Christ
(paciencia maioris iniurie) increased His prerogafrve. So will it be for
our king too. 2¹¹³. Clernency would stand in the way of just punish-
ment. — Nu, lor God will punish them as they deserve, if they are
lelt to Him. BesideS, let the possessions ol the clergy make good the
losses ol the secular lords, and we shall have conrpensation enough.
δή. All fear of consequences would be destroyed, should the guilty

escape. — Retter filial than servile fear, replies Wyclif. Their punish-
ment will in any case, whether summary or judicial, be the cause
ol much hatred and disunion in the kingdom. The king and secular
lords, and the clergy especially, have been much to blame in the
matter (pp. 200, 201). We should lollow Christ's example ol mercy.

who was accused by the rebels almost in those very terms.
