monachism, and Lanfranc holds that we are quite justified in with·
drawing from a monastery where our salvation is in danger. Such
use 01 the Papal authority would be 111 better than commanding
angels and regulating things 01 the next world, as Wyclil complains
that ‘Pope Clement³ - perhaps Robert 01 Geneva - had done in
a certain bull of his.

,nd The second head 01 accusation is False Wisdom, which is
very briefly disposed of. 11 the Pope possesses the power 01 the keys,
he must claim 101 himself supernatural wisdom in order to use thern
properly; but facts sufficiently disprove this assumption, and it must
be made 101 111 that.

trdFeigned benevolence. Here the temporal power, constantly
asserted by the Popes to be indispensable 101 the good government
of the Church, and to be only claimed out of zeal and charity, is
affirmed to proceed 110111 quite contrary motivas. 11 11 were necessary,
God would not allow it to be taken away; and the Pope’s want of
success shows that his temporal power, condemned hythe 1111 01
Christ, is displeasing to God. We should rise up and refuse to obey
him, hut the perils 01 such acourse render it more prudent to stand
aside and await events. Wyclil darkly hints at a miraculous inter-

Pope.A After complaining of the exaltrng 01 tradi rons the abasement
01 Christ's school, and the putting forward 01 evil doctrines under
the appearance of good, Wyclif exemplifies the latter in the case of
the Eucharist. lt is idolatry to adore the visible Sacrament as God,
for it certainly is not God. It is adored under pretext 01 devotion:
idolaters may be very devout, but false devotion cannot please the
God 01 truth. The more abject the sign worshipped, the greater the
crime: now, the Host is, according to these men, nothing but a lot
01 empty appearances3 it is therefore the most degrading of all
idolatries. The people believe that the Host which they see is iden—
tical with Christ; and the Friars, wishing, as they say, 10 favour
popular devotion, allow this error to prevail, though their own doctors¹
